## ðŸŒŽ Programming is about the passsion. ðŸŒŽ
Hello there! I am Sevelar, also known as SevDev or just Sev! I am a beginning developer specialising in web programming and a trainee. I still learn frontend programming languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript, React.js or Vue.js. I have a little knowledge of backend coding as well, as C++ was my very first programming language I have learnt.
