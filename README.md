## ðŸŒŽ Programming is about the passsion. ðŸŒŽ
Hello there! I am Sevelar, also known as SevDev or just Sev! I am a beginning web developer and a trainee in an IT company! I still learn frontend programming languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript, Node.js, React.js or Vue.js. I have a little knowledge of backend coding as well, as C++ was my very first programming language I have learnt (Also computer architecture and things like Raspberry Pi or Arduino make me really interested, lol).
